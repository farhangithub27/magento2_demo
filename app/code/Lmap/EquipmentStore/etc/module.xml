<!--xml file is required because firstly
 It lists module dependencies in sequence tag that have to be loaded first before the module
 is loaded. This can be important in case if our module references a table in a database for a setup script that is
 created by another module. If dependencies are not mentioned then our module will load and migrations would fail
 because the reference table wouldn't exit yet.
 Magento uses sequence tag whenever magento enable or disable is run to build a directed acyclic graph which is then used
 to determine the order of modules that is written in the app/etc/config.php file.

 Secondly, xml file specify the module setup version. This version is used to determine which database migration
 (or setup scripts) to execute and current version for each module is then stored in the database table setup module.
 Magento 2.3 introduces declarative schemas and deprecate setup version attribute.
